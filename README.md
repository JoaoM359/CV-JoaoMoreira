# CV-JoaoMoreira


## Brief introduction

The idea of creating this app came from letting recruiters know my technical skills in iOS development.

The application is a representation of my CV in app form.

Hope you like it :)


## Technologies

The app was developed taking into account the cutting edge of innovation in iOS development, that is, using Swift as the programming language and SwiftUI as the Interface Builder.

I tried to use the MVVM pattern, however, as there is almost no logic, I considered that it would not be advantageous to have the ViewModel layer.
